## Architecture
The project follows the *microservices* architectural style. 
We have three independent microservices (User, Site and Organization), which connect to MySql database and  communicate with each other using RestTemplate. We use *Docker Compose* for deploying and running them on docker containers.

## Technologies
This project is created using the following technologies:

1. Java 8
2. Maven Dependency Management	
3. Spring Boot in microservices development:
	
	+ Spring Web
	+ Spring Data JPA
	+ Spring Devtools
	+ Spring Actuator
	
4. MySql database
5. Docker

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You need to install the following software:
 * Java JDK 1.8+
 * Maven 3.0+
 * Git client
 * Docker Compose: To [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Developing Steps
The steps to be taken in order to create working microservices-based system using Spring boot and Docker:
	
**Step 1.** Building the *microservices* using Spring Boot and communication between them by RestTemplate:

+ [User microservice](user-service)
+ [Site microservice](site-service)
+ [Organization microservice](organization-service)

**Step 2.** Creating the *Dockerfile* for each service. Docker file is a list of commands that we want the docker engine to execute. 

Go to the directory for each spring boot project and create a Dockerfile:

+ User microservice [Dockerfile](user-service/Dockerfile)
+ Site microservice [Dockerfile](site-service/Dockerfile)
+ Organization microservice [Dockerfile](organization-service/Dockerfile)

For example Dockerfile for User service:

```bash
From openjdk:8
copy ./target/users-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar user-service.jar
CMD ["java","-jar","user-service.jar"]
```

**Step 3.** Creating [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) as follows:

```bash
version: "3"
services:
  organization:
    build: ./organization-service
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
    networks:
      - organization-mysql
      - organization-user
      - organization-site
    depends_on:
      - mysqldb
      - user
      - site

  site:
    build: ./site-service
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
    networks:
      - organization-mysql
      - site-user
      - organization-site
    depends_on:
      - mysqldb
      - user
 
  user:
    build: ./user-service
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    networks:
      - site-user
      - organization-user
      - organization-mysql
    depends_on:
      - mysqldb

  mysqldb:
    image: mysql:8
    networks:
      - organization-mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=organizationdb

networks:
  organization-mysql:
  site-user:
  organization-user:
  organization-site:
```
**Step 4.** Running and testing applications: 

Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs your entire services.
 
### Setup
To run this project, install it locally as follow:

1. **Clone the application**

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/SayedBaladoh/Deploying-and-Running-Multiple-Spring-Boot-Microservices-with-MySql-using-Docker-Compose.git
	```

2. **Create a JAR file for each service**

	Run maven command - *clean install*, and a jar file gets created in the target directory for each service like so:

	```bash
	cd service_directory
	maven clean install
	```	
	+ *service_directory*: the directory of the service (user-service, site-service and organization-service).	

3. **Start the User, Site, Organization and MySql using docker-compose**

	The project includes a [*docker-compose.yml*](docker-compose.yml)  file so you can Run *docker-compose up* to start entire services, no installation needed.

	```bash
	cd solution_directory
	docker-compose up -d
	```
	You can see - 
	- Building an image from Dockerfile for each service and image for MySql database If it does not exist.
	- Building containers (user, site, organization, and mysql) using the images.
	- Starting the services (user, site, organization, and MySql).
	
4. **Check the created images**

	Use the following command to check the created images:

	```bash
	docker images
	```
	
	You should find the created images like in the next figure:
	![created images](images/docker-images.png)	

5. **Check the created containers**

	Use the following command to check the created containers:

	```bash
	docker ps -a
	```

	You should see the results like the next:
	![User, Site, Organization, and MySql are UP and RUNNING](images/docker-ps-a.png)		
		
6. **Check the logs**

	Use the following command to check the logs for each container:

	```bash
	docker container logs CONTAINER_ID
	```
	
### Running

To access the services use the following endpoints

**Run the User/Site/Organization microservices**
	
The user microservice will start on port `8081`, So you'll be able to visit the user microservice under address `http://localhost:8081`. 
	
The site microservice will start on port `8082`, So you'll be able to visit the site microservice under address `http://localhost:8082`.

The organization microservice will start on port `8083`, So you'll be able to visit the organization microservice under address `http://localhost:8083`.
